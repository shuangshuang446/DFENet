DFENet Intro.

Sensor-based human activity recognition (SHAR) has attracted considerable attention due to the development of wearable sensing technology. Despite significant progress in SHAR through deep learning methods, developing a model that can enhance feature representation without adding extra computational burden remains a common issue. On the one hand, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are proficient at extracting local spatial features, they fall short in capturing the temporal dynamics across multiple sensor modalities. On the other hand, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of processing sequential information but are hampered by inefficiency. To this end, we propose an efficient Dynamic Feature Enhancement Network (DFENet) for SHAR tasks. Specifically, DFENet incorporates the Sensor Signal Feature Refinement (SSFR) and Dynamic Spatial-Channel Mask (DSCM) modules to deliver accurate action recognition with efficient computation. The SSFR module efficiently removes spatial and channel redundancies in features to extract key action-related information, while the DSCM module dynamically skips unnecessary computations and selectively activates relevant spatial and channel regions. We evaluate DFENet's performance on four public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.73\% on UCI-HAR, 98.31\% on WISDM, 93.44\% on PAMAP2, and 76.52\% on UniMiB-SHAR with negligible computational burden, which highlights its efficiency in SHAR tasks.
